     <p1> Increasing sustainability awareness and purchase transparency <br>

       <p2>
       <br> There has been a shift within industries towards providing more eco-friendly products + services, as well as increasing societal pressure to change, and heightened demand for products marked as "sustainable". NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business conducted a study using IRI provided data, which consisted of 73,293 products purchased across 36 categories, and they were able to determine that consumer packaged products marked as "sustainable" experienced significant market growth. Another area experiencing significant market growth is M-commerce, which is the purchase of goods and services using a smartphone. M-commerce purchases have been increasing at a rate of 33.8% a year since 2016*.</p2>

     <h2> Can we redesign a popular mobile application to help promote sustainability? </h2>

    <div class = "textBox3">
    <p3>
 <br>With over 150 million users, Amazon is currently the most popular mobile shopping application in America. Furthermore, as demonstrated by user interviews, direct observations, and surveys, many users are unaware of Amazon's "Climate Pledge", which includes partnerships with multiple organizations to offer certified products that promote sustainability. Users who are interested in these products reported experiencing frustration when shopping for them, and a large percentage of users reported that they would purchase sustainable products if it was simply more convenient for them to do so.
 </p3>

                     levels ranging from high school graduate to Master's degree <br>

       <figcaption> It is interesting to note that 8.3% of users actively seek <br>
                    sustainable products, but 25% experience frustration when <br>
                    shopping for them. This strongly suggests that frustration <br>
                    is preventing users from purchasing sustainable products.

So if I saw Amazon highlight those products, I would probably be more inclined to purchase them."<br><br></li>

        <h4> Filters </h4>
           <p5> Amazon's current filter menu has excellent options. However, because there are so many choices and the scroll page is so long, users reported having trouble finding the filters they need. Our redesigned filter menu arranges the filter categories by buttons, making it easier to see the options and focus on the desired categories. Each category button will open its own menu of selections where users can choose a desired filter and immediately check the results, go back to the "Filters" menu to select more filters, switch to the "Compare" feature tab, or close the "Filters" menu. The buttons have been designed to have the same appearance as other buttons within the application to provide consistency. The funnel icon for "Filter" and "X" icon for Close" have been added to make the dropdown menu aesthetically pleasing, and the word "Filters" appears next to the funnel icon at the user entry point for users who are unfamiliar with the funnel symbol. A "Seller Reviews" option has been added to the filter for "Customer Reviews" because users who previously had bad experiences with particular sellers would like a way to ensure a product they are considering is being sold by someone who values customer experience.</p5>

        <h4> Climate Pledge Filter </h4>
           <p5> To help raise awareness for the Climate Pledge and make it easier to shop for Climate Pledge Friendly items with special certifications, we placed the certification logos directly in the search results items listings and in the new "Compare" feature's table, and we created a Climate Pledge Filter which will pop up whenever a list of search results has items with at least two Climate Pledge certifications. The filter will allow users to select their favorite certifications from the list.  </p5>

        <h4> Compare Feature </h4>
           <p5> Many users reported that they would like to be able to compare items of their choosing. Amazon currently has a comparison table, but it is only listed towards the bottom of the individual item description list for select items. We took that same table and gave it a dedicated tab within the filters tab so that users can quickly compare items by simply adding them directly from the search results list as they shop. While the majority of users were familiar with the funnel icon, there were no suggested icons for the "Compare" feature that users were able to recognize. As a result of this finding, an icon will not be used for this feature.</p5>
